# ChBrus
Hi There, my nickname is ChBrus, but you can call me "Brus" if you feel better. I'm from Mexico, actually. I'm currently a programming studen on my highschool. Although, I'm a teenager, I'd like to be a great videogame developer and that's my goal.

## Currently projects
I'm currently developing a roblox videogame - at this time we're on July, 2023. My goals on this game are that I want to do a webpage and I'd like to connect some data since my website to my roblox videogame.
