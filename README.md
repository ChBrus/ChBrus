	‚å®Ô∏è Aspiring Backend Developer üñ±Ô∏èüëå
I'm from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and my passion lies in becoming a backend developer. Beyond coding, you'll often find me playing the piano or ukulele, hitting the gym, or diving deeper into the world of technology. Watching programming videos has become a cherished hobby of mine.

## Experience
### Dual Education Internship `2023 - 2024`
During my dual education at DIF, I honed my skills as a developer while still in high school. Here are a few projects I worked on:

#### Formulario Caritas - Satisfaction Survey
As the sole leader of the project, "Formulario Caritas" was a customer satisfaction survey aimed at gathering feedback from clients. It served as my initiation into project leadership and collaborative development. Key learnings from this project include:

- **Modularization**: I learned to modularize my files more effectively, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- **Frontend-Backend Interaction**: I devised methods to fetch backend information from the frontend without relying on any frameworks, thereby expanding my understanding of frontend-backend interaction.
- **Unit Testing**: I utilized a single framework for unit testing, gaining practical experience in ensuring code quality through testing.
- **Team Collaboration**: Despite being the sole leader, I delegated tasks to my only teammate, fostering collaboration and teamwork dynamics.

This project marked the beginning of my journey into team-based development, providing valuable insights into project management and software engineering practices.
